# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

This application is a simple employee management system. You can not only check the departments, roles and employees in the database, but you can update them as well.

The biggest selling points are the fact that the database is immune to injection attacks and that it is easy to ease and formats itself in an easy to read way.

This application uses SQL, as a means to store and organise data. It also uses nodejs to get input to fill into the SQL database.
